# TDML

TDML is a specification for a new markup convention designed for list-making. TDML stands for To-Do Markup Language. The goal of TDML is to standardize how I create and manage to-do lists, and to hypothesize a framework for to-do list data such that it could theoretically be ported between platforms with ease. 

## Basis

To-do tools are omnipresent. Lists have long been important to productivity for many, and recent years have seen an explosion in applications that serve this organizational strategy, to the point where the to-do app has become as common a portfolio piece for young designers and developers as the type specimen book or the show poster. TodoMVC has turned the simple to-do list into a conceptual constant in the process of learning any of an exhaustive list of javascript frameworks.

Increasingly, I find myself unhappy with many of these tools. My preference is for a simple text file, or pen and paper. And I donâ€™t feel alone in my desire for freedom from the imposed taxonomies and hierarchies of whatever to-do tool has most recently figured out the supposed best structure for me to be productive. This is not to decry the utility of such tools, but rather to acknowledge that this ecosystem is _not_ evolving toward some paragon of productivity, but rather is a diverse and complex system built of countless variations on a theme that cater to the desires of individual creators in hopes of sympathesis.

TDML is thus a proposed framework to standardize the language of list-making and preserve the list itself in its ever-changing and inconsistent context.

## Goals

1. Create a flexible and adaptable text-based system for creation, prioritization, and interaction with lists.
2. Create a de facto data model for lists that can be easily imported and exported from the list-making app _du jour_.

## Structure & Syntax

### List Items
All lists are built of list items. The list item is the universal building block of the list. List items are not inherently actionable items, as in a to-do list where an item is done or not done, but are instead simply discrete ideas related to the topic of the list.

A standard list item is denoted by an asterisk and a space.

`* this is a standard list item`

An item can be marked as done by adding a modifier character before the asterisk. The modifier to mark an item as done can be either a `/` or a `-` character.
